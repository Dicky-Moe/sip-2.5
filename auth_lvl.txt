Authentication levels
=====================

Applicability. This specification is REQUIRED for SIP 2.5, but may be adapted for other protocols (SIP, or even SS7).
It is implemented by SIP intermediaries, i.e. proxies and B2BUA, for ingress messages, both requests and responses. It works on message-by-message basis.
Levels for authentication of an ingress message are:

o 0. No authentication.
If a message cannot be authenticated, it MUST be dropped without further processing. There is no alternative for responses; but for requests there could be an error code. But what's the difference?

o 1. UNI (User-Network interface)
This level requires:
oo IP address filtering, or topology restriction, or equivalent router options (VPN?). Note: avoid injecting messages into arbitrary point of the network. Users connect through access network only.
oo Authentication from underlying transport (e.g. TLS), or HTTP-like (based on password or SIM).
No trust to P-A-Id; regenerate it from other authentication. Allowed From or To header are defined by accompanying "trust" specification.

o 2. INI (Inter-Network interface)
This level requires:
oo IP address filtering (strict whitelist), or topology restriction.
oo Firewalls
Underlying transport authentication (TLS with certificates) may be employed.
P-A-Id is trusted, unless it is clearly spoofed, e.g. as the message is coming from "this" network (domain).

o 3. NNI (Network-to-Network interface)
This is the highest level. It MUST employ all relevant restrictions, including IP filtering (up to requiring the same subnet), secure transports.
