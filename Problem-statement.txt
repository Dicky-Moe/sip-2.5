Hello All,
Maybe this is wrong WG (sipcore would be better). But I have some notes on
SIP (and VoIP in general) future development. At least I want that. I dare
even to say that telephone wasn't invented by Bell; it is uninvented yet.
;)

1. Support for call pick-up, and other remote call control (remote call
rejection, remote answering).
 Note: I am working on an I-D for this (over 25 years...). I suggest a new
method, PICKUP.
One more note: call pick-up is specified for H.323 (H.450.5), and DPNSS1
defines all remote call control. 2. Easy conferences without any
supporting infrastructure, similar to H.323, as opposed to RFC 4575etc. No
way to join a SIP conference in the same way as H.323. Note: may require
to normatively update existing RFCs. 3. Standard call management codes, as
GSM USSD. 4. Tons of headers, with arbitrary grouping of parameters (see
my earlier post on From: and To:), and redundancy. Example: transaction-id
in Via: header and a pair of dialog-id, CSeq, which also uniquely
indentifies a transaction. 5. Overload of INVITE with much potentially
unused data (e.g. Caller-name when it is not displayed). The same is true
for SS7 and H.323. Proposed solution: inquire some data only when needed;
specify an Info-package for this. 6. D-channel bearer equivalent. I guess
it is really undesired. Or, specify an Info-package. 7. True P2P (no
infrastructure). Based on IP multicast.This is out of scope of current
P2PSIP WG.

Any comments? Clearly, 4 is for next versions of SIP (if ever), maybe 6G
(tm).

Hello All,
Thanks to everybody who answered.
Let me go into details.
I define "telephony" as real-time inter-personal communication. By SIP, I
mean a protocol family, not the protocol. 
>[MB]  There have been proposals
for call park and call pickup. You can see here why the work was not
progressed: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/bliss/current/msg01107.html 

As I understand that message, authors of some I-D withdrew their proposal. The
same for another I-D. I don't think that binds me. "No one implements"
does not sound as a reasonable argument for me. I cannot use it because no
one implements, no one implements because no one uses. For conferences,
SIP requires conference URI. For that, there must be routing function
recognizing them and routing requests to appropriate focus, focus service
itself, conference factory that allocates and assigns conference URIs, at
least. In P2P scenarios, nothing of this would be available. Suppose
someone (Alice?)  starts a conference. Anyone wishing to join knows only
Alice's address. Currently, in H.323, this is sufficient, but not in SIP,
as there is no way to indicate "join". More to come... 
Sincerely yours,
Anton.


Letter by 2019-09-04:
RFC 3911 requires a conference URI. This implies that
1) there is one;
2) this URI is known to the caller beforehand.

My original idea was to send Join: without URI (and normatively update RFC
3911 for that). Anyway, IMO some (syntax level) indication needed to
indicate that an INVITE is a request to join rather than just a call. Even
though such an INVITE contains no session description. Actually, this
might mean 3pcc.
