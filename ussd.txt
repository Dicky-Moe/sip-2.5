SIP 2.5 USSD
Note: SIP does not support USSD; W-CDMA or GSM is required. SIP 2.5 can.

As equivalence to USSD, use URIs:
- sip:ussd@local.invalid (if addressed to the serving network)
- sip:ussd@home.invalid (if addressed to the home network)

The method is INVITE (if a dialog is expected, or by default) or MESSAGE (if no dialog).
The content of the request should be text/plain for keyboard input, including * or # based.
The response is
- 200 for INVITE, if dialog is established;
- 200 for MESSAGE;
- 499 for INVITE, if no dialog.
The content is text/plain if it is for user display.
Further messages are INFO requests and responses, and a BYE (possibly empty) is the last.
