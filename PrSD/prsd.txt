Protocol Stack Description (PrSD)

This is a replacement for the Session Description Protocol (SDP). It is designed for simplicity, and non-IP bearers (such as Hybrid Transfer Mode). 

A protocol parameter is a name=value pair. Names are protocol-specific, though there are few (see below) designed for use with miltiple protocols.

A protocol entry consists of a protocol name (a token) with optional parameter list. The list consists of parentheses () with comma-separated parameters inside.
BUGBUG: This implies that spaces are not used as separators. Should we allow them inside parameter values?

A major media type is token-only (no parameters).

A media stream descriptor consists of:
# optional (?) direction flag: "+" both, "|" forward, "\" backward, "-" none;
# major media type;
# "/"-separated protocol entries, in top-down order (as in TCP/IP).

The protocol descriptor consists of common part and media stream descriptors, each on its line (separated by CR LF). The common part is "*" with a parameter list in parentheses.

If a new version of the PrSD contains new streams, they are appended at the end. Streams are never removed, only direction may be none.

Common parameters are: 
 l - local address (for network or transport protocols),
 l1 - auxillary local address (e.g. RTCP for RTP),
 r - remote address,
 r1 - auxillary remote address,
 b - bandwidth (kbps),
 k - encryption key.
 
Known protocols are:
 rtp (parameter: pt)
 srtp
 tls
 tcp
 udp
 sctp
 ip4
 ip6
 ipx
 spx
 ipsec
 aal0
 aal1
 aal2

 aal5
 
Global parameters defined:
 b (see above)
 s - subject (e.g. conference)
 t - time and repetition
 
Example:
 audio/pcma/rtp(pt=8)/udp(l=13000,r=14000,l1=13001)/ip6(l=2001::1234)
