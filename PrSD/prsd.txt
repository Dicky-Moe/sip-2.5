Protocol Stack Description (PrSD)

This is a replacement for the Session Description Protocol (SDP). It is designed for simplicity, and non-IP bearers (such as Hybrid Transfer Mode). 

Each stream description consists of protocol names, each followed by protocols parameters (if any), separated by a slash (/).
Stream descriptions are separated by CRLF.
Protocols are written top down.
Protocol parameters are enclosed in parentheses (), consist of name=value pairs, separated with commas (,).
Predefined parameters are: 
 l - local address (for network or transport protocols),
 l1 - auxillary local address (e.g. RTCP for RTP),
 r - remote address,
 r1 - auxillary remote address,
 b - bandwidth,
 k - encryption key.
 
Top level protocols (i.e. the first in each stack) is actually a stream major type; it does not define any format or encoding. Common types are audio, video; other registered types are application, control, image, message, text.

Known protocols are:
 rtp (parameter: pt)
 srtp
 tls
 tcp
 udp
 sctp
 ip4
 ip6
 ipx
 ipsec
 aal0
 aal1
 aal2
 aal34
 aal5
 
In addition, "*" pseudo-stack is used to define global parameters:
 b (see above)
 s - subject (e.g. conference)
 t - time and repetition
 
Example:
 audio/pcma/rtp(pt=8)/udp(l=13000,r=14000,l1=13001)/ip6(l=2001::1234)
 
Known subtypes are:
audio/*
video/*
application/bfcp
application/l2tp
image/t38
message/msrp
